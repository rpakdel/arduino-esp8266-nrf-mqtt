# ESP8266 connected to sensors via NRF24L01 publishing via MQTT

* RobotDyn ESP8266-PRO connected to NRF24L01 listening to three pipes.
* ESP8266-PRO publishes sensor values to Mosquitto server.

* Three remote sensors connected to Arduino Pro Mini send values to ESP8266-PRO via NRF24L01.
* Sensors go to sleep periodically and put the radio to sleep as well.
* Sensor ID 0 is connected to a button and runs on 3 AA batteries. 
 * Interrupt routine wakes up Arduino and NRF24L01 radio when button pressed.
 * Arduino and radio go back to sleep after sending message.

* Node-RED on Raspberry Pi decides what to do with sensor messages.
* Sensor ID 0 messages toggle IKEA Tradfri wireles outlet via CC2531 Zigbee module connected to Raspberry Pi.

Another view of the Arduino and NRF24L01. Had many connection issues with the female headers. Also many issues with power stability which required 2x 0.1uF capacitors.
